Namely, Moynihan said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Tuesday that the banking industry will become an active player in offering crypto payments, CNBC reported. \\u201cIf the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you\\u2019ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,\\u201d Moynihan, who helms the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, said. \\u201cIf you go down the street here and you go in and buy lunch, right, if you can pay with Visa (V-0.18%), Mastercard (MA-0.76%), a debit card, Apple Pay (AAPL+1.68%), etc., this would just be another form of payment,\\u201d Moynihan said. \\u201cWe have hundreds of patents on blockchain already, we know how to enter the field.\\u201d Bank of America received a record 644 patents in 2023, 6% of which were in blockchain technology.

Last week, Apple agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that Siri covertly recorded conversations for more than a decade \\u2014 even when the voice assistant wasn\\u2019t activated using the trigger words, \\u201cHey, Siri\\u201d \\u2014 from users of its iPhones, iPads, watches, headphones, computers, and smart speakers. The lawsuit claimed that Apple then shared that data with advertisers. Apple did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, although some social media users  interpreted the payout as confirmation of Apple using its voice assistant to spy on users. The company said in its statement that Siri \\u201chas been engineered to protect user privacy and is the most private digital assistant.\\u201d Apple also underscored that it doesn\\u2019t keep audio recordings of Siri interactions unless users explicitly opt in to help improve Siri. Even then, the company said those recordings are used solely for that purpose. If approved, the settlement would allow for tens of millions of Apple customers who owned devices from September 17, 2014, through December 31, 2024, to file claims. Consumers can receive up to $20 for every device they own equipped with Siri \\u2014 with a cap at five devices per individual \\u2014 although payments could be adjusted depending on how many claims are filed. Only a fraction of eligible customers are expected to file claims. The settlement represents only a sliver of Apple\\u2019s nearly $94 billion net income in the last fiscal year. \\u2014 William Gavin contributed reporting.
