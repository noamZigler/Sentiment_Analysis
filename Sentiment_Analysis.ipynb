The iPhone maker is expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter \\u2014 an increase of more than 3% from the previous year, according to analysts\\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.04%).

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.\\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness. The founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%. In his interview for the book\\u00a0Efficiently Inefficient,\\u00a0Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis. Asness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following: \\u201cI\\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\\u201d Following a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto. Despite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash. Our Methodology To make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. AQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion Global tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services. On January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders. In its\\u00a0third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\\u00a0following\\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): \\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\\u201d Overall AAPL ranks 2nd\\u00a0on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Sign in to access your portfolio\",\n          \"The nation\\u2019s highest court is preparing to hear the case against banning one of the most popular social media platforms in the U.S. In April, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill requiring China\\u2019s ByteDance to find a U.S. buyer for its video-sharing app, TikTok. ByteDance, which has expressed its unwillingness to sell TikTok, was given until January 19 to find a buyer or face a ban. That would make TikTok unavailable for download in the U.S. from the App Store (AAPL+1.74%) and the Google Play Store (GOOGL+1.90%) and restrict U.S. internet service providers from allowing access to the platform. TikTok, which counts more than 170 million U.S.-based monthly users, filed a lawsuit arguing that the legislation \\u2014 the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act \\u2014 violates its First Amendment rights. However, the law was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in December, which argued that the Chinese-owned app is a potential threat to national security. \\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\\u201d Judge Douglas Ginsburg said in the majority opinion. \\u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\\u201d Now, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments from TikTok and its parent, ByteDance, on Friday \\u2014 just over a week before the ban is expected to go into effect. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to delay implementing the ban until he enters office so that he can look into the case. Trump reportedly met with TikTok CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate in December. The Justice Department, meanwhile, has pushed back and asked the Supreme Court to reject Trump\\u2019s request. Here\\u2019s what to know about the upcoming Supreme Court hearing, and what could happen if TikTok gets banned. Lawmakers have raised national security concerns over TikTok\\u2019s ties to China since it gained massive popularity in the U.S. during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite being owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, TikTok has said it operates separately from its parent company and that its data centers are located all over the world \\u2014 but notably not in China.  In its filing with the Supreme Court, TikTok says the platform \\u201cis provided in this country [the U.S.] by TikTok Inc., an American company that is indirectly owned by ByteDance Ltd., a Cayman holding company majority-owned by institutional investors.\\u201d Still, the U.S. is concerned that the app could be pressured to share user data with the Chinese government, and that it can be influenced to show certain types of content to U.S.-based users. Trump said in December that he has a \\u201cwarm spot\\u201d in his heart for TikTok, which he credited for delivering support from younger voters. One of Trump\\u2019s major backers, billionaire Jeff Yass, owns a $15 billion stake in ByteDance, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire\\u2019s Index. The incoming president, however, wanted to ban TikTok during his first administration, citing national security concerns and claiming the app\\u2019s data collection would give the Chinese Communist Party \\u201caccess to Americans personal and proprietary information.\\u201d Trump\\u2019s executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. was blocked by a federal judge and then revoked by the Biden administration in 2021. Under a new executive order, President Biden called China \\u201ca foreign adversary\\u201d that \\u201ccontinues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States\\u201d by controlling \\u201csoftware applications\\u201d \\u2014 i.e. TikTok. If TikTok does get banned before Trump re-enters office, a provision in the law would allow him to pause the ban for 90 days if ByteDance can prove it is selling the app. He could also ask the Justice Department and attorney general not to enforce the TikTok ban, according to Alan Rozenshtein, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School. TikTok is asking the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court\\u2019s ruling that it can infringe on free speech rights over national security concerns. The platform argued in its filing with the Supreme Court that banning it \\u201cwill silence the speech of Applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts, and other matters of public concern.\\u201d TikTok also noted that small businesses that depend on it \\u201cwill suffer substantial and unrecoverable monetary and competitive harms.\\u201d \\u201c[I]f Americans, duly informed of the alleged risks of \\u2018covert\\u2019 content manipulation, choose to continue viewing content on TikTok with their eyes wide open, the First Amendment entrusts them with making that choice, free from the Government\\u2019s censorship,\\u201d the company said in its filing. People who\\u2019ve finally decided to give TikTok a try will be out of luck, with both options to download the app or access it via the web blocked. Meanwhile, current TikTok users won\\u2019t exactly lose access to the app (and it won\\u2019t disappear from your phone), but it will become \\u201cunworkable\\u201d over time without support and updates, according to the Justice Department. Earlier this week, \\u201cShark Tank\\u201d investor Kevin O\\u2019Leary said he is planning to partner with billionaire businessman Frank McCourt and his non-profit, Project Liberty, to buy TikTok. \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t just about buying TikTok\\u2019s U.S. assets. It\\u2019s about something much bigger: protecting the privacy of 170 million American users. It\\u2019s about empowering creators and small businesses. And it\\u2019s about building a platform that prioritizes PEOPLE over algorithms,\\u201d O\\u2019Leary said in a post on X. In December, McCourt, who founded Project Liberty, said he was building a consortium of associates to buy the platform to avoid the ban. The group, called the \\u201cPeople\\u2019s Bid For TikTok,\\u201d wants to allow users to control their own data. According to Project Liberty, the bid has received \\u201cexpressions of interest of over $20 billion in capital.\\u201d On Thursday, the group made a formal offer to buy TikTok and relaunch it \\u201con a new, American-made digital infrastructure.\\u201d During an appearance on CBS\\u2019s (PARA+1.82%) \\u201cFace the Nation\\u201d in December, McCourt said Project Liberty would only acquire the U.S. portion of TikTok \\u2014 not the algorithm, which the Chinese government considers its intellectual property. Last May, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was interested in buying TikTok\\u2019s U.S. portion, and that the app\\u2019s algorithm technology could be rebuilt by U.S. companies. \\u201cI\\u2019ve actually spoken to a lot of tech companies on working about rebuilding this,\\u201d Mnuchin told Bloomberg. \\u201cI do believe the algorithms could be rebuilt. So my plan, if we were to purchase, it would be to rebuild the technology under US leadership, make sure that it\\u2019s all disconnected from ByteDance going forward, and that it is very robust and secure.\\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.23957263407993826,\n        \"min\": 0.4374,\n        \"max\": 0.9983,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9741,\n          0.9983,\n          0.9974\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
